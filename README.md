### HORROR answer to SlickRun.
For years i have been using a lot of open source code, one thing i have not though is contributing to the open source community, that is about to change.

## Keymaster
Do you know what SlickRun is?

### SlickRun 
SlickRun is a free floating command line utility for Windows made by Eric Lawrence. SlickRun gives you almost instant access to any program or website. SlickRun allows you to create command aliases (known as MagicWords), so C:\Program Files\Outlook Express\msimn.exe becomes MAIL. Enter a web URL into SlickRun and it will launch your browser and navigate to the specified address. Run multiple programs in a few keystrokes, jot a note, look up a definition... SlickRun is the most natural way to interact with your computer.

### Keymaster
Keymaster is actual the same thing, so why bother to do it one more time? Well i have been us Eric Lawrence SlickRun for Years now and i just love the concept, but SlickRun is dead, nothing new is added and i have a fairly amount of troubles with it, which came along with windows 8, so there you have it. I what to use Eric Lawrence concept and make that project open source.
