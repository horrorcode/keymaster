SlickRun gives you almost instant access to any program or website. SlickRun allows you to create command aliases (known as MagicWords), so C:\\Program Files\\Outlook Express\\msimn.exe becomes MAIL. Enter a web URL into SlickRun and it will launch your browser and navigate to the specified address. Run multiple programs in a few keystrokes, jot a note, look up a definition... SlickRun is the most natural way to interact with your computer.\r\n\r\n## Keymaster\r\nKeymaster is actual the same thing, so why bother to do it one more time? Well i have been us Eric Lawrence SlickRun for Years now and i just love the concept, but SlickRun is dead, nothing new is added and i have a fairly amount of troubles with it, which came along with windows 8, so there you have it. I what to use Eric Lawrence concept and make that project open source.\r\n \r\n## Contributions\r\nIf you feel that you would like to contribute send me an email so we can discuss what and how :-)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd git/keymaster\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
